<div id="body1"><div id="pic"></div><div id="content"><p>We want to travel faster. Work faster. Communicate and connect faster. We're a society fixated on speed, because we're a society fixated on technology.
It's our collective accelerator. As technology moves, we move. But the same technology that fulfills our need for speed also poses our biggest challenge.
Because technology doesn't just increase the speed at which we move, it increases the speed at which change moves.</p>
    <p> For two decades Sapient has helped its clients anticipate, navigate and leverage change. Our deeply engrained technology heritage, running through all of our businesses like a foundational thread, has allowed us to utilize technology to its fullest business application and creative expression, giving our clients something that, in today's business climate, they simply can't succeed without: the ability to quickly and confidently adapt to ever-changing conditions.</p>
    <p> Throughout our history, Sapient has demonstrated to companies across a wide spectrum of industries and geographies, that success doesn't rely solely on how you manage your business, but also, on how you manage changes that affect your business. And, at no other time has that been more applicable, more profoundly relevant, than now.</p>
